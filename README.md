# [FARRENC TRIO](https://raymondbrien.github.io/farrenc-trio)

The Farrenc Trio is a classical chamber music ensemble based in London who were in need of a custom website, with two primary goals: establishing an online presence 
and creating numerous opportunities for music professionals to get in touch with the trio directly for bookings and enquiries.
Farrenc Trio as a site aims to promote the trio's work, versatility and online presence in a simple and clean way, laying out information in clearly definited pages with 
responsive media and good SEO. The four pages (which, as they appear on the website are named 'Home', 'Contact', 'Services' and 'Gallery') prioritise and categorise information 
in order of relevance to the trio's goals for the site, from most important to least important. 

The site has been designed mobile-first, given the high liklihood that the majority of users for the site will visit the site using mobile devices, at least as a first visit.

First impressions online for festival promoters in particular are essential; the site aims to cater particularly with promoteres in mind, taking into account specific 
areas of information that are directly relevant to them such as 'Biography', 'News' and 'Repertoire' sections respectively.

## UX

The user experience has been designed to ensure that information which is direclty relevant for the target audience of event promoters and festival promoters is never more than two 
actions away, through four clearly labelled headings, each with subheadings and icons associated with its attached title (such as a statue for 'classical' subheading in the repertoire page)
to easily categorise and find information using visual aids.
There is at least one opportunity per page to link directly to the 'Contact' page, no matter whether the website is visited on mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop machine, highlighted in a
different color than the rest of the page.
These designs are intended to be in line with the primary goal of having a clear website which establishes an online presence with a good SEO and enables promoters to contact the trio 
directly for bookings.

### Colour Scheme

- `#D9D7D7` primary text for dark backgrounds / main background color
- `#1F1E26` primary text for light backgrounds / secondary text
- `#485953` used for primary highlights
- `#0B0B0D` used for secondary highlights


I used [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) to generate and inspire my colour palette which were taken directly from the photos which were going to be featured numerous times throughout the site for continuity.
